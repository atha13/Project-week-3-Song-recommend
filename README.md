## Project Description
In this project I will show you the magic of finding new music with an extraordinary "song recommendator".

## Questions & Hypotheses
It was important to start creating a data basis with many songs for the ML to start working. It still needs more and there is room for improvement in the coding.

## Dataset & Database
Since we learned this we how to find information online (diff ways), that is what I implemented to create a starting data base with more than 30K songs.

## Workflow
- Looking for information online (top100 and Spotify)
- Choosing playlists from Spotify (the larger the better)
- Exploring and cleaning data
- Defining how many type song groups would be optimal to start analysing the data
- Connecting the different data frames through the code
- Try and error... finding what needed to be corrected
- Writing the presentation
- Recording the 3 minutes presentation

## Organization
The organization depended this week along on the course agenda. Different days we learned new processes, and these were implemented afterwards.
